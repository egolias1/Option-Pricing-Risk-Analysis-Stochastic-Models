# Option-Pricing-Risk-Analysis-Stochastic-Models
This repository contains a comprehensive project on option pricing and risk analysis using stochastic models in quantitative research and analysis.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a rough framework for option pricing and risk analysis by implementing and calibrating stochastic models. The project includes data preprocessing, model selection, parameter estimation, option pricing, risk analysis, and sensitivity analysis.

## Project Structure
This project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the historical financial market data used for this project.
- `preprocessing/`: Includes scripts for data cleaning, alignment, and calculating implied volatility.
- `model/`: Contains the implementation of stochastic models including the Black-Scholes-Merton and Heston Models.
- `pricing/`: Includes scripts for option pricing based on the selected stochastic models and estimated parameters.
- `risk_analysis/`: Contains scripts for conducting risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation
- `sensitivity_analysis/`: Includes scripts for performing sensitivity analysis on model parameters and market conditions.
- `results/`: Stores the generated outputs, including option prices, risk metrics, and visualizations.
- `docs/` : Contains the project documentation, including the report summarizing the project objectives, mothodologies, and findings.
